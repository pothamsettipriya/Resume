<h1  style="background-color:red;color:white;">BEAUTY OF NATURE</h1>
<h2><u><i>SAVE NATURE</i></u></h2>
<div>
	Viewed from space, <sub>our blue planet seems</sub> as familiar as a long-time friend – so familiar <strong>that we forget how extraordinary it really is</strong>. As far as we know, our <mark>world is unique in the universe, defined by three elements</mark>, Air, Land and Water. Each element has<sup> its own special properties and phenomena and is home </sup>to myriad lifeforms that have infiltrated every habitat, from the deepest oceans to the tiniest nooks and crannies.

    Across three enthralling episodes, ‘Earth – The Nature of Our Planet’, explores mysteries of the plant and animal kingdoms; weather and geological phenomena and nature’s wonders, from the perspective of the elements. Air, Land and Water are not only the stages for this dramatic theatre of life, but dynamic spheres in their own right, connected to one another through surprising relationships.
